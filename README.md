# Covid-19-Dashboard
🌍 Just wrapped up a cool project visualizing COVID-19 data from 2020! 📊

I took a deep dive into the numbers, showing how the virus spread across countries and regions throughout the year. 🌏📆

📈 Used charts and graphs to make sense of the data, illustrating the ups and downs of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries. It's like a visual story of the pandemic.

🗺️ Whether looking at specific countries or tracking trends over time, the visuals tell a powerful tale of the global fight against COVID-19.

💡 The idea is to make sense of the numbers so we can make better decisions. Sharing this project to spark conversations and keep the dialogue going on how we tackle pandemics.

🙏 Let's learn from the past, understand the present, and work towards a safer future. Together, we can visualize our way forward. #COVID19 #DataViz #StaySafe
